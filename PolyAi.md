```
function mintToken(address target, uint256 mintedAmount) onlyOwner {
        balanceOf[target] += mintedAmount;
        Transfer(0, owner, mintedAmount);
        Transfer(owner, target, mintedAmount);
    }
```

The  PolyAi token could be arbitrary minted by its creator in function mintToken(). The balanceOf[target] and mintedAmount are a defined as uint, so oprator '+' would definitely result in an integer overflow. What's more,the totalSupply is not increasement when the mintToken is called.
